# IASC 2P02 

## Amanda Caron

Hello there! My name is Amanda Caron. My major is Interactive Arts and Science at Brock University and I am currently finishing my second year. I believe with what I have learned throughout this course is that my specialization for the future is mostly within a mix between media archeology and built media scholarship. When I graduate I hope to go into the field of Digital Marketing and I believe these specializations will be present there. What has happened in the past with media and technology has affected our future and how we interact with media and technology. Throughout my time in the IASC program I have done multiple projects on how the past has influenced the future of media. This gives me a fresh and new outlook on interactive arts and how they will be influenced in the future. The main reason I have chosen to go into the field of Digital Marketing is because it embodies everything I want within a career from the Digital Humanities. I want to be able to be able to create content as well as see how previous content has influence audiences.
