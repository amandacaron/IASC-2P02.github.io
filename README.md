# IASC 2P02 

## Amanda Caron

Hello there! My name is Amanda Caron. My major is Interactive Arts and Science at Brock University and I am currently finishing my second year. I believe with what I have learned throughout this course is that my specialization for the future is mostly within a mix between media archeology and built media scholarship. When I graduate I hope to go into the field of Digital Marketing and I believe these specializations will be present there. What has happened in the past with media and technology has affected our future and how we interact with media and technology. Throughout my time in the IASC program I have done multiple projects on how the past has influenced the future of media. This gives me a fresh and new outlook on interactive arts and how they will be influenced in the future. The main reason I have chosen to go into the field of Digital Marketing is because it embodies everything I want within a career from the Digital Humanities. I want to be able to be able to create content as well as see how previous content has influence audiences.

				My featured project focuses on how the English Department can be evolved by the Digital Humanities. Digital Humanities are the future of many programs within the schooling system. It just takes certain people and or generations time to get used to the new concept. Many people are used to the traditional methods of teaching and learning. But without our control the world is evolving and so are learning and teaching methods. The world is forever developing and changing to keep up with new creations within the technology and digital humanities industry. What many peopled do not realize is that the Digital Humanities can improve our English Departments. Digital Humanities offer new materials to better the students and often the teachers teaching experience. Students will have access to library databases to help them read scholarly articles that would otherwise not be available to them. Allowing students to broaden their knowledge is an asset brought forward through the Digital Humanities. The main contribution brought forth from the Digital Humanities into English Departmetns is the immense amount of new tools. New learning tools, databases, definitions, and translators all in one place. The digital humanities are in every type on technology we use. As Kirschenbaum wrote,” digital humanities is implicit in every mission statement, every call for papers and proposals, every strategic plan and curriculum development document, every hiring request, and so forth that invokes the term.”
        
       With being given the chance to reconstruct my academic blog post I gained more time to reflect on the articles I chose and even gain new ideas. This allowed me to add new concepts to my initial blog post. In regards to what I changed after reading the instructors feedback I altered quite a bit. I firstly re-read Kirschenbaum article again and found new ideas to reference in my blog post. I saw that his numerous examples that he shared that seemed boring before were actually very intriguing the second time around. I honestly think I never gave them a chance at first and am glad I re-read the article. Next I took the new ideas I found and made a whole new paragraph in my post. After doing so I went and took out the portion where I go into my personal experience because it is not relevant to Kirschenbaum article. Then I tried to find any spelling or grammar errors I could to correct. Lastly, I chose one approach to focus on, “a more research-based mode that relies of quotes and scholarly argumentation” as you noted. I personally like working with many quotations to bring forward examples and support my opinions.  Overall my main agreement with Kirschenbaum stayed the same, I believe the digital humanities have brought forth countless tools that have helped and even revamped our English department today.
