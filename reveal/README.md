  ### Project Description

  
  The collaboration project my team decided to work on was a program called Zotero. Our group decided to present the information we gathered on the program and make a slideshow for the class. Our slideshow consisted of twelve slides that discussed how Zotero worked, its purpose, history, accomplishments, and upgrades the products have made since it first began. We initially chose this project because of its purpose and how helpful it can be to students. Many students today struggle with finding academic sources to cite to compose research papers. Well this program makes bibliographies for the works you find. This in the end makes your work a little easier.

### Collaborative Statement
  
  As soon as my team decided what project to focus on we immediately made a slideshow document on google docs and shared it with all of our group members enabling everyone to be able to edit the document. This program allowed everyone to see each other’s work and who was doing what, and if they were staying on track with their given section. We also allowed others to change our own work so that everyone ideas could be expressed. After creating the google doc we decided who would feel comfortable talking about each portion of the project and that would be what the individual would do research on. Along with having this shared document we also stayed in contact via email frequently and would meet before and after classes to touch base. Communication is always the top priority in group projects. Group projects are always good because you get the chance to have other ideas besides your own. You get to see how others perceive the project and what they think the pros and cons of it are. How Zotero could be useful and why it is not. One also gets the chance to research different aspects of the project that they may normally not do, and this can give them new outlooks on the project itself.  At the end of the day group projects can be quite difficult, but having a “home base” such as our Google doc makes things go a lot smoother, and also when you have numerous classes with your partners.
