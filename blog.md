# Digital Humanities in English Departments... I agree

     Today I am choosing the article “What Is Digital Humanities and What’s It Doing in English Departments” written by Matthew Kirschenbaum to discuss and review. This article had me agreeing throughout the article with many of the points it brought forward. The article speaks about, “people who say the last battles of the computer revolution in English departments have been fought and won don’t know what they’re talking about,” and how, “we are just learning how to live with computers, just beginning to integrate these machines effectively into writing- and reading-intensive courses.” This idea of just beginning to integrate these systems effectively into reading and writing courses within the English department is what I agree with most throughout this article. Computers are becoming more depended on as the years go by. Although some schools are replacing certain teaching aspect such as learning cursive writing with new computer applications; computers have a lot more to offer for educational and new learning purposes. Computers can help students expand their knowledge and learn more then reading from a textbook in today’s day and age. 

     The article also notes that once you google a definition it brings you to Wikipedia, where Digital Humanities was described just as it should be. “The digital humanities, also known as humanities computing, is a field of study, research, teaching, and invention concerned with the intersection of computing and the disciplines of the humanities… It involves investigation, analysis, synthesis and presentation of information in electronic form…” so even though Wikipedia is viewed as an unreliable source, its data is not always invalid. I would like to now draw from this definition and focus on the main terms that appear; study, research, teaching, and invention. These terms are main concepts that one would use within an English department. The teacher and the student can relate to all of these terms on different levels. A teacher studies and does research for their lesson as the student studies and does research for the curriculum, in order to do assignments and complete tests.  A teacher mainly teaches, but many teachers implement students teaching chapters of certain books as well. Lastly, they are both inventors, whether it comes to the teacher inventing each assignment or each student inventing their final portfolio. Breaking down the individual statements made within this Wikipedia definition make it easy for one to understand how exactly Digital Humanities fit within the English department. 

     As many of you may know the love for digital humanities is not quite apparent in today’s society. Everything about digital humanity seems like it has come about and is just “there” for most people. Many are not even aware of what the digital humanities are and how they use them on their day-to-day lives. Countless people are also unaware of how using digital humanities within the English system has many advantages and benefits. Kirschenbaum elaborates on why digital humanities benefit English Departments and this is what he explains that there is decades of research in fields like stylistics, linguistics, and author attribution studies, a great association between computers and composition, the immense convergence between the intense conversations around editorial theory and method in the 1980s and the widespread means to implement electronic archives and editions, available hypertext and other forms of electronic literature, the openness of English departments to cultural studies, where computers and other objects of digital material culture become the centerpiece and analysis, and lastly the explosion of interest in e-reading and e-book devices like kindle, iPad, and nook and the advent of large-scale text digitization projects, the most significant of course being Google Books. While technology is growing and peoples need for technology grows so does their dependancy for using devices within the schooling system.

     This proves that using computer applications to your advantage can be easier and much more resourceful. Throughout middle school I personally never depended on my computer. We were taught to do research though books. You go to the library and you read in order to find quotes and data to support your analyses. With the use of computers one has an infinite amount of information and easier access to that information and resources. The article also expresses that,  “digital humanities is also a social undertaking. It harbours networks of people who have been working together, sharing together, arguing, competing, and collaborating for many years”.  To support this claim I pulled a quote from Chapter 4 of Hermeneuti that says, “the perceived importance of Digital Humanities has changed our sense of our community and inclusiveness”. From my own perspective digital humanities provide new ways of doing scholarship that involve collaborative, and computationally engaged research, and publishing. One of the best examples of this is the application Google Drive. This software allows you to share documents with anyone you desire, whether you share the link or the file. It brings collaboration to a new epidemic. Might I also add that next to research, information, and collaboration computers offer, they can provide great application for creating documents and presentations for one to thrive within their given course. 

     Lastly, While attempting to find a definition of what Digital Humanities really is, I came upon these two definitions by two completely different authors, “an interdisciplinary field in which scholars and educators bring computational tools and methods to humanistic inquiry” (p.113, William Fenton) and, “Digital Humanities is most frequently associated with the computational analysis of text, from the Bible to modern literature.” (p.20 , Gregory Mone) This shows that even many of us today still do not fully understand the capabilities of the digital humanities. Furthermore Daniel Kim once wrote, “to date, the application of computing to literary studies has been primarily in stylometry (or stylistics) and in the structural analysis of texts. In these areas, scholars have demonstrated the value of text analysis software to studies of authors and texts. But an important figure has been left out of the field of literary computing: the reader.” This statement shows that instead of allowing “elders” or the people that are not within the English Department to determine whether or not digital humanities is beneficial because they are not the ones actually using the technology, the readers are.
     
     Overall, Digital Humanities is closer and closer to receiving the recognition it deserves. It has been a major contribution to the future of many English departments. It has aided the studies of students as well as “graduate students, faculty members (both tenure line and contingent), and other academic professionals” says Kirschenbaum article. Hermeneuti also notes that, “Digital Humanities seems to have gone from a marginal field trying to gain respect to the favourite of university administrators.” As a student and almost a graduate student I one hundred percent know that I will always be relying on my digital resources when not only completing any English assignments in the future, but mainly any assignment.
